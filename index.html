        <h1>Congratulations, Bill!</h1>
        <p><i>A note from The Webmaster:</i></p>
        <p>
          Twenty-two years ago, as a freshman in college, cheap and creative
          Christmas gifts were the order of the day. In a comically large box, a
          wrapped up a scrap of paper to give to my father.
        </p>
        <p>
          <tt>________________.com</tt>, it read. He'd only been in real estate
          for a couple of years, but as a child of the internet, it seemed
          obvious that a new website would complement his burgeoning career.
        </p>
        <p>
          That website became this one, Lake Vermilion Real Estate, with the
          domain name to match. For more than two decades it's been a reliable
          and trusty source of information about the market, and a glimpse into
          the life of an agent and broker in northern Minnesota.
        </p>
        <p>
          With great admiration and celebration, the time has come to put the
          website to bed, as my father, Bill Tibbetts, your estimable host of
          LVRE, is retired as of today.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's time to enjoy those boat rides as something beyond a "business
          trip", Pa. (Though, it's a pretty gig, if you can get it.) You've
          earned it.
        </p>
        <p>Love,<br />Your son, The Webmaster</p>
